 empires_economic_grip_desc: "As a jewel in the crown of the British Empire, our nation's wealth and resources are tightly bound to the interests of London. Our economy, shaped by imperial demands, feeds the insatiable appetite of the metropole. While we gain access to global markets, it is the Empire that holds the reins, ensuring that the lion's share of our prosperity flows back to the heart of the Empire."
